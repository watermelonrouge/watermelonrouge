				<h4>Our Thesis</h4>
				<p></p><p>EDR is a "transition story," with plans to increase production by 50% by 2019E through the development of Terronera. AISC are expected to decline 30% over the same time frame.</p><p></p>
				<h4>Valuation</h4>
				<p></p><p>Our valuation is based on a 2017E payable production <font>forecast of 5.4Moz silver and 54koz gold at co-product all-in sustaining cost of US$21.44/oz silver equivalent. The target price is based on a 50/50 weighted blend of 1.7x P/NPV adjusted for market capitalization and 10.0x P/CF adjusted for growth.</font></p><p></p>
				<h4>Upside Scenario</h4>
				<p></p><p>3.0x NAV multiple at BMO prices ($20/oz long term).</p><p></p>
				<h4>Downside Scenario</h4>
				<p></p><p>1.0x NAV multiple. Spot silver price declines back to $15/oz level and sector multiples collapse.</p><p></p>
				<h4>Company Description</h4>
				<p></p><p>Endeavour Silver operates three mines located in historical silver districts in Mexico. The company is focused on evaluating and developing its greenfields pipeline of the prospective El Compas, Terronera and Parral projects.</p><p></p>
